            8/21/23 Week 1 <br>
              Todays exparament was very exiting. We used pvc pipes that were cut horizontally as a <br> 
            pathway for a marble. The goal was to get the marble from the starting piont to a small bucket <br>
            about 25 feet away. And everybody in the group had to use a pvc pipe at least once. We all worked <br>
            together to make a plan and almost succeeded. Our group made it to the end but unfortunately it <br>
            bounced off and did not make it in the bucket. But over all I had a great time! <br>
